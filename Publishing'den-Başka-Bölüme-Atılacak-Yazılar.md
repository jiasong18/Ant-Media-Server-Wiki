### Step 3: Configure the Ant Media Server

Contact with us from [contact form](https://antmedia.io/#contacts) in order to try Ant Media Server Enterprise Edition. Extract the Ant Media Server Enterprise zip file and start the server with start.sh command in the terminal. For detailed information please follow steps described in the [Getting Started](https://github.com/ant-media/Ant-Media-Server/wiki/Getting-Started).
```
cd /path/to/ant-media-server

./start.sh
```

After that, you need to create a live stream on Ant Media Server Enterprise Management console. You can reach it at `http://<server-address>:5080` address, then click `WebRTCAppEE` from Applications section and `New Live Stream`. The server creates a live stream with an unique ID with the format of `rtmp://<server-address>/WebRTCAppEE/325859929809451108600212`. You can copy this url with clicking clipboard icon.

### Step 5 : Start Stream and Watch ðŸ™‚

Close settings window and just click the `Start Streaming` button in the main window of OBS. You can watch WebRTC stream from either Ant Media Management console or other platforms such as VLC player with same RTMP URL.

To Play with WebRTC, go to `http://<server-address>:5080/WebRTCAppEE/player.html` and enter the stream key parameter and click "Start Playing" button.

You can also play on Ant Media Management console which plays via HLS at about 8-10 seconds latency. A dialog will be displayed where you can watch the live stream.
