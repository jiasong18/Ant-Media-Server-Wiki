## Licenses

Ant Media Server has basically two types of licenses. 
1. Ant Media Server Community Edition is free to use.  
2. Ant Media Server Enterprise Edition has a paid license per instance. Paid license options are hourly, monthly, annually and perpetual. You can get licenses from [antmedia.io](https://antmedia.io) or you can use hourly licenses from Marketplaces in [AWS Marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/search/results?x=0&y=0&searchTerms=Ant+Media+Server&page=1&ref_=nav_search_box), [Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps?search=Ant%20Media%20Server&page=1). 

#### Enterprise Cluster License
Enterprise Cluster License is almost same as the Enterprise License. Enterprise Cluster License supports many instances run simultaneously with the same license key. On the other hand, Enterprise License key only supports one instance at a time. 

If you're planning to have a large deployment for your Enterprise Cluster, please contact with Sales in order to  have some discounts. 

#### Free Enterprise License for Education, Tech Communities and Startups
Ant Media provides *free Enterprise Licenses** for the *students, academics, communities and early stage startup companies*. To get advantage of this opportunity, just send an email (from your institution, company or community e-mail address) to contact@antmedia.io

## Architectural Overview

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mekya/antmedia-doc/master/images/Simple_Architecture.png)

## Supported Environments
Ant Media Server runs on **Linux(Ubuntu)** and **MacOS**.  it supports only x64 architecture. 
Ubuntu 16.04 is officially supported and auxiliary scripts are provided for Ubuntu 16.04. In addition, It's known that Ant Media Server is used on Centos, SUSE, Debian distributions as well.

## Extensions
### Object Recognition with TensorFlow
Ant Media Server can use trained deep learning model to recognize objects in the live streams.
This is a CPU intensive process so if you enable this feature, server's CPU consumption will increase. 

Meanwhile, users can use any deep models to execute for the live streams on the fly.
