Ant Media Server can be easily deployed on the Amazon Web Services Instances. Please note that; this documentation describes single instance deployment. Let's have a look at the steps.


### Step 1 Log in to AWS Console

First, you need to log in the [AWS Console](https://aws.amazon.com/console/). If you donâ€™t have an AWS account, you need to [register](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup#/start) first. Then you are able to use AWS services.

### Step 2 Create an Instance

After logging in to AWS Console, you will see the list of AWS Services. Click on the EC2 ([Elastic Computing](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/concepts.html)).

### Step 3 

Let's have a look at how to pull stream from IP Camera. Of course, first, you need to install Ant Media Server, please see <a href="https://antmedia.io/documentation/">documentation</a>.
<h2>Add IP Camera</h2>
Select "LiveApp" from applications, then click "New Live Stream" and select "IP Camera". Fill camera name, camera username, and camera password. You should define ONVIF URL of IP Camera. Generally, it is IP-ADDRESS-OF-IPCAMERA:8080.  Another promising feature comes :) You can use "auto-discovery " feature! If cameras and server are in the same subnet, Ant Media Server automatically discovers them. The screenshot of  auto-discovery result is shown below.

<h2>Watch IP Cameras</h2>
If the IP cameras are reachable and configured correctly, Ant Media Server add theirs streams as live streams and starts to pull streams from them. You can see its status on the management panel.
