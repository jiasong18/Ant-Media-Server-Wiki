## Quick Start

*Ant Media Server 1.2.0+ runs on Linux and Mac not on Windows.* 

Let's start, we assume that you have got Enterprise Edition somehow and downloaded to your local computer 

1. Extract the downloaded file in to a directory.

2. Make sure you have installed Oracle Java 8

    * Installation Java 8 on Ubuntu
      ```
      $ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/java
      $ sudo apt-get update
      $ sudo apt-get install oracle-java8-installer
      ```
    
    * Installation Java 8 on Mac
      * Follow the guide [here](https://java.com/en/download/help/mac_install.xml)

3. Open a terminal and go to directory where you have extracted Enterprise Edition

    ```
    cd /path/to/ant-media-server
    ```
   
4. Start the server with start.sh script. 

    ```
    ./start.sh
    ```
    It starts by printing some logs to the terminal.
 
5. Open the browser(Chrome or Firefox) and go to the `http://localhost:5080/WebRTCAppEE`. 
    Let browser access your camera and mic unless it cannot send WebRTC Stream to the server

    _WebRTCAppEE stands for WebRTCApp Enterprise Edition_
   
6. Write stream name or leave it as default and Press `Start Publishing` button. After you press the button, 
    "Publishing" blinking text should appear

   to check how it plays and what the latency is.
