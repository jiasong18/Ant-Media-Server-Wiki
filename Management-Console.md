# Cluster Page
Cluster page can be opened from the sidebar of the management console. In cluster page, there is a cluster table in which cluster nodes are listed as rows. 
In cluster mode, each node registers itself to MongoDB as a cluster node. All registered nodes are listed in the cluster table even if it is off at the moment.
