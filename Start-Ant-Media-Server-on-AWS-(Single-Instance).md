Ant Media Server can be easily deployed on the Amazon Web Services Instances. Please note that; this documentation describes single instance deployment. Let's have a look at the steps.


## Step 1) Log in to AWS Console

First, you need to log in the [AWS Console](https://aws.amazon.com/console/). If you donâ€™t have an AWS account, you need to [register](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup#/start) first. Then you are able to use AWS services.

## Step 2) Create an Instance

After logging in to AWS Console, you will see the list of AWS Services. Click on the EC2 ([Elastic Computing](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/concepts.html)).

EC2 dashboard shows a summary of current resources. Click on **Launch Instance** button.

At this stage, you need to select Amazon Machine Image. Click Ubuntu Server from Quick Start tab.

After your image selection, you need to define the instance type which is compatible with the image.

You need configure security parameters. Please keep in mind that, Ant Media Server needs following ports to operate. Here are the ports that server uses;

* TCP:1935 (RTMP)
* TCP:5080 (HTTP)
* TCP:5443 (HTTPS)
* TCP:5554 (RTSP)
* UDP:5000-65000 (WebRTC and RTSP)

At the last stage, AWS creates a key file to connect your instance. If you have created before for your other instance, you can continue to use it for your new instance also. Do not forget to download the key file you have not before.

## Step 3) Monitor and Connect

Once you have successfully started instance then you can monitor it in the Instance Panel easily.

To connect your instance, select your instance and click the **Connect** button to get connection instructions.

You need to first configure permission of the key file correctly.

`chmod 400 ant.pem`

Then connect using ssh credentials. Such as:

`ssh -i ant.pem ubuntu@ec2-3-120-228-117.eu-central-1.compute.amazonaws.com`

## Step 4) Install Ant Media Server

Just apply 2 basic steps that described in the  [Getting Started](https://github.com/ant-media/Ant-Media-Server/wiki/Getting-Started) page in order to install Ant Media Server easily. Basically you need to;

* Download installation script and define required permissions `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ant-media/Scripts/master/install_ant-media-server.sh` and `chmod 755 install_ant-media-server.sh`

* Run installation script `sudo ./install_ant-media-server.sh [ANT_MEDIA_SERVER_INSTALLATION_FILE] `
