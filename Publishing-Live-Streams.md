Ant Media Server can ingest/accept WebRTC and RTMP streams and can re-stream RTMP, HLS, RTSP streams by pulling from stream source. It can also convert RTMP Publishing and Re-streaming(RTSP,RTMP) to WebRTC with providing ultra low latency streaming.


## WebRTC Publishing

There are three ways for WebRTC Publishing:

1. Publish with Web browser (Mobile and Desktop)
2. Publish with Mobile App (Android and iOS)
3. Publish with Embedded SDK


## RTMP Publishing

There are three ways for RTMP Publishing:

1. Publish with a Desktop Software (OBS, XSplit, Wirecast)
2. Publish with a Hardware Encoder (Teradek, Tricaster, Gosolo)
3. Publish with a Mobile App - (Android, iOS)

## Re-streaming (RTMP/HLS/RTSP)

Re-streaming means that Ant Media Server can pull a RTSP/RTMP stream from a RTSP/RTMP Server(IP Camera, Linear Stream Source) and can broadcast to many with WebRTC (Ultra Low Latency: 0.5 seconds) or HLS(Low Latency: 6 - 12 Seconds). There are mainly two ways for Re-streaming.

1. ONVIF IP Camera
2. Stream Source
