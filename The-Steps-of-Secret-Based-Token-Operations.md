Ant Media Server will offer secret-based token security control option with 1.7.0 version.

### Enable Setting and Define Secret Key

Firstly, the settings should be enabled from the settings file of the application.

```json
settings.hashControlPublishEnabled=false

settings.hashControlPlayEnabled=false

tokenHashSecret=

```
Set true "settings.hashControlPublishEnabled" to enable secret based hash control for publishing operations, and "settings.hashControlPlayEnabled=" for playing operations.

Also, do not forget to define a secret key for generating a hash value.



## The Steps for Secret Based Token Control Mechanism

### A) Publishing Scenario

#### Step 1. Generate a Hash

You need to generate a hash value using the formula sha256(STREAM_ID + ROLE + SECRET) for your application and send to your clients. The values used for hash generation are: 

`STREAM_ID:  The id of stream, generated in Ant Media Server.`

`ROLE: It is either "play or "publish"`

`SECRET: Shared secret key (should be defined in the setting file)` 



#### Step 2. Request with Hash 

The system controls hash validity during publishing or playing.

**RTMP Publishing:** You need to add a hash parameter to RTMP URL before publishing. Sample URL:

`rtmp://[IP_Address]/<Application_Name>/<Stream_Id>?token=hash`

**WebRTC Publishing:** Hash parameter should be inserted to publish WebSocket message.
```json
{
    command : "publish",
    streamId : "stream1",
    token : "hash",
}
```

 For details about WebRTC WebSocket messaging please visit [wiki page](https://github.com/ant-media/Ant-Media-Server/wiki/WebRTC-WebSocket-Messaging-Details).

### B) Playing Scenario

#### Step 1. Generate a Hash

You need to generate a hash value using the formula sha256(STREAM_ID + ROLE + SECRET) for your application and send to your clients. The values used for hash generation are: 

`STREAM_ID:  The id of stream, generated in Ant Media Server.`

`ROLE: It is either "play or "publish"`

`SECRET: Shared secret key (should be defined in the setting file)` 

#### Step 2. Request with Hash 

**Live Stream/VoD Playing:** Same as publishing, the hash parameter is added to URL. Sample URL:

``http://[IP_Address]/<Application_Name>/streams/<Stream_Id_or_Source_Name>?token=hash``

**WebRTC Playing:** Again the hash parameter should be inserted to play WebSocket message. 

```json
{
    command : "play",
    streamId : "stream1",
    token : "hash",

}
```

Please have a look at the principles described in the [wiki page](https://github.com/ant-media/Ant-Media-Server/wiki/WebRTC-WebSocket-Messaging-Details).


### Evaluation of the Hash

If related settings are enabled, Ant Media Server first generates hash values based on the formula sha256(STREAM_ID + ROLE + SECRET) using streamId, role parameters and secret string which is defined in the settings file. Then compare this generated hash value with clients hash value during authentication.

Once the hash is successfully validated by Ant Media Server, client is granted either to publish or play according to application setting and user request.
